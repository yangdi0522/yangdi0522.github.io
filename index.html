<article>
Standing at the crossroads of 19th-century American poetry and modernism, Robert Frost holds a unique and almost isolated position in American letters.
</p>

<p>
The American poet Robert Frost was born on March 26, 1874, in San Francisco, CA. He spent his first 40 years mostly unknown, and it was not until after returning to the United States from England where he had his first two books of poetry published, near the beginning of the first World War, that he was truly recognized by the publishing world as the talented word-smith he was. During his later life he earned four Pulitzer Prizes, and as the unofficial U.S. "Poet Laureate" he was a special guest at the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy in 1961. He died of surgical complications two years later, at the age of 88.

<h1>
The Road Not Taken
</h1>

<p>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
</p>
<p>
And sorry I could not travel both
</p>
<p>
And be one traveler, long I stood
</p>
<p>
And looked down one as far as I could
</p>
<p>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Then took the other, as just as fair,
</p>
<p>
And having perhaps the better claim,
</p>
<p>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
</p>
<p>
Though as for that the passing there
</p>
<p>
Had worn them really about the same,
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
And both that morning equally lay
</p>
<p>
In leaves no step had trodden black.
</p>
<p>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
</p>
<p>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
</p>
<p>
I doubted if I should ever come back.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I shall be telling this with a sigh
</p>
<p>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
</p>
<p>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -
</p>
<p>
I took the one less traveled by,
</p>
<p>
And that has made all the difference.

<h1>
The Road Not Taken: The Poem Everyone Loves and Everyone Gets Wrong
</h1>

<p>
"The Road Not Taken" has confused audiences literally from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty with "The Road Not Taken" starts, appropriately enough, with its title. Recall the poem's conclusion: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I - / I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference." These are not only the poem's best - known lines, but the ones that capture what most readers take to be its central image: a lonely path that we take at great risk, possibly for great reward. So vivid is that image that many readers simply assume that the poem is called "The Road Less Traveled". Search-engine data indicates that searches for "Frost" and "Road Less Traveled" are extremely common, and even accomplished critics routinely refer to the poem by its most famous line. For example, in an otherwise penetrating essay on Frost's ability to say two things at once, Kathryn Schulz, the book reviewer for New York magazine, mistakenly calls the poem "The Road Less Traveled" and then, in an irony Frost might have savored, describes it as "not-very-Frosty."
